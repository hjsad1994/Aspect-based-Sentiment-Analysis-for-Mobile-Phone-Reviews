WEIGHTED VOTING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

COMPLETED: Successfully implemented weighted voting system in consensus_voting_interactive.py

USER WEIGHTS CONFIGURED:
  - nhhoangthong:     1.5 points (highest priority)
  - dangdoai3:        1.4 points
  - ah3cu102:         1.3 points
  - quangvinh02200:   1.2 points
  - Default (others): 1.0 points

KEY FEATURES:
1. Highest-Weighted User Selection
   - Automatically picks the vote from the user with highest weight
   - Simple and direct: nhhoangthong (1.5) always wins over others
   
2. Conflict Resolution
   - Detects when weighted winner differs from simple majority
   - Auto mode: automatically selects weighted winner
   - Interactive mode: shows both options, suggests weighted winner
   
3. Edge Case Handling
   - Unknown users get default weight (1.0)
   - Perfect agreement bypasses weighted voting
   - Empty annotations handled gracefully
   - Ties resolved deterministically

4. Backward Compatibility
   - Existing functionality preserved
   - Can disable weighted voting with --no-weighted flag
   - All original features still work

MODIFIED FILES:
  - D:/AI_Tranning/ai_training/scripts/consensus_voting_interactive.py
  
BACKUP CREATED:
  - D:/AI_Tranning/ai_training/scripts/consensus_voting_interactive.py.backup

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
  - get_user_weight(annotator): Extracts username and returns weight
  - weighted_vote(values, annotations): Calculates weighted voting result

MODIFIED FUNCTIONS:
  - display_annotations(): Now shows weights and weighted scores
  - majority_vote_with_review(): Uses weighted voting logic
  - consensus_with_manager_review(): Added use_weighted parameter
  - main(): Added --no-weighted command line option

USAGE EXAMPLES:

  # Auto mode with weighted voting (default)
  python consensus_voting_interactive.py data.csv --auto
  
  # Interactive mode with weighted voting
  python consensus_voting_interactive.py data.csv
  
  # Disable weighted voting (use simple majority)
  python consensus_voting_interactive.py data.csv --no-weighted

TESTING:
  All tests passed successfully:
  ✓ User weight retrieval
  ✓ Weighted score calculation
  ✓ Conflict resolution (weighted overrides simple majority)
  ✓ Highest weight wins when all annotators differ
  ✓ Unknown users get default weight

DOCUMENTATION:
  - Full documentation: D:/AI_Tranning/ai_training/scripts/WEIGHTED_VOTING_README.md
  - Includes examples, scenarios, and technical details

VERIFICATION:
  - Syntax check: PASSED
  - All test cases: PASSED
  - Ready for production use

STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE AND TESTED
